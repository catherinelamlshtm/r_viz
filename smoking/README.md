Sam Clifford's presentation to Introduction to Statistical Computing on the use of tidyverse.

You need to install the tidyverse package to run the code in the practical document file, which uses the `Gestation` data from the mosaicData package.

```
install.packages(c("mosaicData", "tidyverse"))
```

If you don't want to, or can't, install the mosaicData pakage, you can download the CSV file [here](Rmd/Gestation.csv).
